# MachineLearningForHealthCare2020
Code to the projects related to the 2020 ETHZ course "Machine Learning for Health Care" by Gunnar RÃ¤tsch.

For all projects, there should be a Jupyter Notebook that runs all the relevant code. Please make sure to include the data in the correct directory, e.g. for ECG_Heartbeat_Classification, put the `.csv` files in `data/ECG_Heartbeat_Classification`.
